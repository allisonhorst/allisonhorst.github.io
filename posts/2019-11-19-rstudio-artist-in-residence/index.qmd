Since I started drawing R- and stats-related illustrations for my students in 2018, I have been overwhelmed by the reception from the #rstats community on twitter. 

I am extremely excited to share that as of October 2019, I am [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)'s first Artist-in-Residence!

You can read more about my motivation and goals for the position on the [RStudio blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/11/18/artist-in-residence/). 

I look forward to sharing a whole bunch more art with you over the next year!
