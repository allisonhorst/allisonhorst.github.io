With Drs. [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) and [Kristen B. Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php), we developed a data package with structural size measurements (and more!) for 3 species of penguins recorded at islands in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The penguins data are a great drop-in alternative to the iris data (which is most commonly cited for its use in eugenicist R.A. Fisher's 1936 publication in *Annals of Eugenics*).
