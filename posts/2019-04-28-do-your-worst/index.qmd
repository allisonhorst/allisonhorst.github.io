In the past I've always asked students to create their *best possible graphs* in `ggplot2` to practice creating clear, engaging data visualizations. Recently, I've realized value in adding a few early exercises that encourage students to make their **worst**.

**Why is it good to make ggplot2 graphs so (intentionally) bad?**

Here are four ways that creating a purposefully disgusting graph promotes learning and exploration in `ggplot2`: 

1. Making **the worst** graph encourages creativity while eliminating the stress of producing a perfect final visualization (unless, of course, it's perfectly hideous)
2. Making **the worst** graph requires extensive customization and code
3. Making **the worst** graph means critically thinking about and identifying contributors to "bad" graphs
4. Making **the worst** graph is surprisingly fun

I was recently inspired to try my absolute dataviz worst by a [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) prompt using data from [Sarah Leo's efforts to improve imperfect graphs in The Economist](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368). 

Instead of trying to recreate or further improve on their graphs, I decided to use my powers and energy for a much different purpose. A darker and more anarchistic purpose... 

Behold, my worst!

The undiscerning eye might think "these graphs are abominations and there was clearly no effort put into them." 

Wrong.

**It's a long dive from ggplot2 defaults into the depths of truly terrible DataViz, and it takes creativity and effort to keep sinking**. 

Here are just a few things I learned or re-learned during my nosedive:

- Arrange multiple graphs with [**cow**plot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html) by [**C**laus **O**. **W**ilke](https://github.com/clauswilke)
- Add figure labels and subtext
- Expand figure margins to let axis labels breathe
- Update fonts and colors in all graph components
- Convert to polar coordinates
- Customizing date formatting on axes

Through the process of trying my worst I learned some new customization skills, created useful reference code for future ggplot2 efforts, and had fun -- it felt oddly liberating to be deliberately and creatively awful. 

From now on, I'll be adding a few early `ggplot2` activities requiring students to do their absolute dataviz worst. There's plenty of room at the bottom, and we can learn a lot *and* have fun on our way down.
