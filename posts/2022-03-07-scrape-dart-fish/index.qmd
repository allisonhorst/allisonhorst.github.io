```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

As a little side project, I decided to scrape data from the [Columbia Basic Research DART (Data Access in Real Time)](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart) to explore fish passage and seasonal trends over time. 

- Check out the exploratory document: https://horst.shinyapps.io/dart_fish/
- Visit the project repo: https://github.com/allisonhorst/dart_salmon_passage

This project involved: 

- A little crawl over web pages with `purrr` (and loving the side effects, like `possibly()`!)
- Web scraping with `rvest` to access fish count tables from > 1500 unique URLs
- Creating a function to access an html table, read it in, and combine with other scraped tables
- Data wrangling (`dplyr`)
- Data visualization (`ggplot2`)
- Interactive visualizations (`shiny` widgets + reactive outputs)
- Next steps: time series analysis & forecasting!
