Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Allison! I'm a Data Scientist Advocate at [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). From 2012 - 2022, I was a teaching faculty member at UC Santa Barbara, where I developed and taught curriculum (statistics, programming, data science, data visualization, science communication) and advised research projects in graduate programs for Environmental Science & Management and Master of Environmental Data Science programs.

I actively work to contribute to open educational resources, including the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) R package, the [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/) package, [The Missing Data Book](https://tmb.njtierney.com/) and through my [data science and statistics artwork](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/). I have worked as Artist-in-Residence at RStudio (2019 - 2020) and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (2018 - 2019).
